I'm a developer at Microsoft with a passion for sharing, development, good engineering fundamentals, machine learning, good documentation and last but not least debugging (memory dump style). I also love anything related to algorithms, programming puzzles, language theory and automata <3.

- **Presentations:** I present, mostly on development, debugging and machine learning - check out my slides and videos here [https://www.tessferrandez.com/presentations/](https://www.tessferrandez.com/presentations/)
- **.NET Memory Dump Debugging:** I blog about debugging and other topics at [https://www.tessferrandez.com](https://www.tessferrandez.com), but you should also try my [.NET debugging labs](https://github.com/tessferrandez/buggybits)
- **Engineering fundamentals:** Me and my colleagues share our ways of working in the [CSE Engineering Playbook](https://microsoft.github.io/code-with-engineering-playbook/).
- **Machine Learning:** We have created [Presidio](https://github.com/microsoft/presidio) to help you analyze or anonymize your PII for Machine Learning tasks. 
- **Trusted Research Environments:** A project for setting up Trusted Research Environments in Azure - [AzureTRE](https://github.com/microsoft/azuretre)
- **Data OPS:** We also share samples and info around Data OPS with Azure from our projects in the [Modern Data Warehouse](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=Azure-Samples&repo=modern-data-warehouse-dataops) repo 
- **Algorithms and Puzzles:** Privately I dabble in competitive programming and love programming puzzles, if you're also a fan, check out my repos for solutions to [Advent of Code](https://github.com/TessFerrandez/adventofcode-python) and general [Algorithm](https://github.com/TessFerrandez/algorithms) puzzler solutions

I also love drawing - here are some sketch notes I created on [Deep Learning](https://www.slideshare.net/TessFerrandez/notes-from-coursera-deep-learning-courses-by-andrew-ng)
